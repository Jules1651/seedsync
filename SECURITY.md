## Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying SeedSync:

1. **Keep SeedSync updated** to the latest version
2. **Use strong passwords** for SSH connections to your remote server
3. **Restrict network access** to the SeedSync web UI (use a reverse proxy with authentication if exposing to the internet)
4. **Use SSH keys** instead of passwords when possible
5. **Review file permissions** on your local download directory
