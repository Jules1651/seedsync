# Milestone v1.1: Dropdown & Form Migration

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 6-8
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Complete UI styling unification by migrating dropdowns to Bootstrap native components and standardizing form inputs with consistent dark theme and teal accent colors.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Dropdown Migration

**Goal:** File options dropdowns use Bootstrap's native dropdown component with correct positioning behavior

**Dependencies:** None (builds on v1.0 Bootstrap SCSS infrastructure)

**Requirements:**
- DROP-01: File options dropdowns use Bootstrap dropdown component
- DROP-02: Custom `%dropdown` and `%toggle` placeholders removed
- DROP-03: Dropdown positioning works correctly (z-index, overflow, flip behavior)

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Migrate dropdowns to Bootstrap native component with dark theme and close-on-scroll

**Success Criteria:**
1. User clicks file options button and dropdown appears below/above button (flip behavior when near viewport edge)
2. User can see dropdown content without horizontal scrollbars or clipping
3. Dropdown closes when user clicks outside or selects an option
4. No `%dropdown` or `%toggle` SCSS placeholders exist in codebase

**Completed:** 2026-02-04

### Phase 7: Form Input Standardization

**Goal:** All form inputs have consistent Bootstrap styling with app-appropriate focus states

**Dependencies:** None (parallel to Phase 6)

**Requirements:**
- FORM-01: All text inputs use consistent Bootstrap form styling
- FORM-02: Checkboxes and toggles styled consistently
- FORM-03: Form focus states use app color scheme

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Add Bootstrap form variable overrides and dark theme styling

**Success Criteria:**
1. User sees consistent input styling across Settings, AutoQueue, and any modal forms
2. User sees consistent checkbox/toggle appearance on all pages
3. User sees teal/secondary focus ring when clicking into any input field
4. Tab navigation shows visible focus indicators on all form controls

**Completed:** 2026-02-04

### Phase 8: Final Polish

**Goal:** Application passes full validation with no visual regressions or unused code

**Dependencies:** Phase 6, Phase 7 (cleanup happens after feature work)

**Requirements:**
- POLISH-01: Full E2E test suite passes
- POLISH-02: Visual QA walkthrough complete
- POLISH-03: Responsive breakpoints tested
- POLISH-04: Unused CSS/SCSS removed

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Run tests, remove unused SCSS, verify build integrity
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Visual QA walkthrough at desktop and tablet widths

**Success Criteria:**
1. All E2E tests pass in CI environment
2. Visual walkthrough confirms no regressions on Files, Settings, AutoQueue, Logs, About pages
3. UI renders correctly at tablet (768px+) and desktop widths
4. No unused SCSS placeholders or variables remain in codebase

**Completed:** 2026-02-04

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**

- CSS variables for Bootstrap theming (easier maintenance, runtime flexibility)
- 150ms dropdown fade animation (smooth but not sluggish)
- 100ms dropdown hover transition (subtle feedback)
- Passive scroll listener outside Angular zone (performance optimization)
- Bootstrap variable cascade for form theming ($component-active-bg propagates teal)
- Focus ring: 0.25rem width, 25% opacity (visible but subtle)
- Disabled form control opacity: 65% inputs, 50% checkboxes

**Issues Resolved:**

- Custom SCSS placeholders eliminated in favor of Bootstrap native patterns
- Orphaned dropdown menus prevented with close-on-scroll behavior
- Inconsistent form styling unified across all pages
- Focus states now use app color scheme throughout

**Issues Deferred:**

- E2E tests require CI infrastructure (localhost:5000 Docker registry)
- Pre-existing lint errors (62 TypeScript strictness issues)
- Sass @import deprecation (migration to @use deferred)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Sass @import deprecation warnings will need addressing before Dart Sass 3.0
